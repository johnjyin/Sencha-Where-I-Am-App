I build ‘whereiam’ Sencha Touch app with following features: 
- Develop tool: Sencha Architect & Sencha Touch (2.*)
- Use HTML 5 Geolocation API to fetch device's geography address: latitude and longitude
- Use Google Map API to convert geo address to real world detail address: no, street/road, city, state, country, postcode
- Use Memory Proxy to read the newly created JSON data (the detail address) into Store and show them out on one data List
- The default Welcome Panel and detail address List are Card Layout children of their common Container, so as to be actived on reqired
